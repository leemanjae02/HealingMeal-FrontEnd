1. The Frontend Deployment was done through the Vercel cloud platform.
2. I create a Dockerfile to build an image of **HealingMeal**. And Push the image to the DockerHub.
3. The Compute Engine, an API of Google Cloud Platform, was used to create virtual machine instances.
4. Then, I create a docker-compose.yml file with informaion about Working Spring Boot(Cloud SQL, API-Key, Mail SMTP).
5. Finally, I can run a command like "docker compose up -d" to start HealingMeal application container.
6. In addition, I use Google Cloud's load balancer to manage the SSL certificate. So Everyone can access Our Service.

# About use of LLM API
- When the diet for user is generated, it is customized for the user with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks.
- Additionally, If the user's diet information is sent through the API, the user can find out the efficacy of the diet by LLM.
- if Users read this efficacy information and prefer the diet, users can save the diet as a bookmark.
